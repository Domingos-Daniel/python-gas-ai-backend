Environment Environment Biodiversity, water, air, soil and the circular economy: our actions to protect the environment are all-encompassing, and we consider nature as a whole. Determined to provide as many people as possible with energy that is more affordable, more reliable and more sustainable, we are committed to preserving and streamlining our use of natural resources.This specifically means that we develop our activities, including renewable energies, while taking action to preserve biodiversity, prevent and control soil pollution, and tackle deforestation. This is also reflected in our efforts to reduce our freshwater withdrawals and limit substance releases to air and water. Lastly, it means playing an active role in promoting the circular economy by developing waste recovery processes and incorporating more circular raw materials into our production systems.Our environment indicators (XLS) Scroll up Scroll down Biodiversity As part of its approach towards carbon neutrality, together with society, TotalEnergies is taking action to preserve ecosystems and biodiversity. The stakes are high for the Company, since its activities are sometimes located in sensitive areas and may have an impact on ecosystems. Therefore, our strategy involves reconciling the development of energy resources with the protection of biodiversity to build a sustainable future. Our biodiversity policy is based on four commitments: respect our voluntary exclusion zones, manage biodiversity in our new projects, manage biodiversity at our existing sites, and promote biodiversity. We look after natural ecosystems Scroll up Scroll down Water According to the UN, more than two billion people currently live in areas where available water resources are insufficient to meet the population’s year-round needs(1). This phenomenon is set to worsen with global warming and is expected to affect one in four people by 2050. Freshwater reserves are useful for TotalEnergies’ activities, but they may be affected by our operations, especially due to the volume of water withdrawals or the substances released. That is why we are focused on our objective of limiting the hydrocarbon content of our water discharges while reducing our freshwater use, especially for sites located in water-stress zones.We preserve fresh water(1) Source: UN-Water/UNESCO - Imminent risk of a global water crisis. ↑ Scroll up Scroll down Air According to the WHO, air pollution is one of the greatest environmental risks to health(2). The Company’s activities generate fumes and emissions that could adversely affect air quality. That is why TotalEnergies is striving to limit such emissions by establishing a standard set of rules for all its affiliates. We are also taking action on our products by developing biofuels and helping accelerate the electrification of land-based mobility.We limit atmospheric emissions(2) Source: WHO - Ambient (outdoor) air pollution. ↑ Scroll up Scroll down Soil Healthy soil is essential to life on earth. For TotalEnergies, preserving the planet’s soil is an asset, since soil is both a support and a resource for our industrial activities. Therefore, we follow a method that is implemented throughout our sites’ lifecycle.We protect the soil Scroll up Scroll down Circular economy The circular economy is an integral part of the transition strategy that TotalEnergies is pursuing to realize its ambition of becoming a world-class player in leading the energy transition and achieving carbon neutrality together with society. By recycling plastic and recovering waste to produce biofuel and biogas, we help preserve natural resources, tackle waste-related pollution and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by lowering our use of raw materials and energy. The Company is also drawing on the circular economy to develop its range of biofuels, biogases and bioplastics.We are actively involved in promoting the circular economy Chapter 5.2 – “Environmental information”Universal Registration Document 2024 Safety Health Environment Quality Charter Learn more (PDF) Environnemental and Social Impact Assessments Learn more All our ESG documentsVisit More Energy, Less Emissions Sustainability & Climate 2025 Progress Report March 2025 Consult
