Social Sustainability Welcome home, Chevening scholars! Another group of talented Angolan graduates have returned from the United Kingdom with their master’s degrees, from the Chevening Scholarship Programme financed by Block 31 partners. Azule Energy has been welcoming returning scholars for years, since 2018, and it is every single time a joy for us, this because we believe in the force of education for building positive impact and for transforming this world of ours into a brighter and better place. The Chevening scholarship programme is the United Kingdom Government’s global scholarship, founded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and other valued 124 partners organizations including ANPG, Azule Energy and our Block 31 partners. .
