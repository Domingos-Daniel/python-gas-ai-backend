Our portfolio of assets includes 18 licenses (including 1 in Namibia), 11 of which operated by Azule Energy. They include oil and gas production and the New Gas Consortium, Angola’s first non-associated gas project. Azule also holds a participation in Angola LNG JV and Solenova, a solar JV with Sonangol developing Caraculo’s photovoltaic project. Operated assets at a glance 11 operated blocks 10 exploration blocks 5 FPSOs 25 MW Photovoltaic installed capacity (Caraculo ph.1 - under development) Oil In 2024 net hydrocarbon production was approximately 210 mboepd, of which oil and condensates accounted for approximately 80%. Expected Net Production in the 2026-2027 period: ~ 250 mboe/d Our assets Floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) units Azule Energy has 5 deepwater FPSOs in its operated blocks, two of which are on lease. These are located in 1300 to 2000m seawater depth with oil production capacity ranging from 80,000 to 200,000 bpd. Hydrocarbons are fed to the FPSOs by subsea production systems consisting of subsea wells, flowlines, manifolds and risers. FPSOs accommodate all processing facilities for oil, gas and produced water, as well as seawater treatment for water injection and have approximately 1.5 million barrels storage capacity. They are also equipped with technologies such as subsea pumping and flowrate measurement, onshore monitoring and surveillance, pipeline slugging control and flash gas recovery systems that enable GHG emissions to be minimised. Once processed, export quality oil is transferred from the FPSO to tankers for export to global markets. Gas Currently, gas accounts for about 20% of Azule’s equity hydrocarbon production. Produced in association with liquids, gas is separated from oil and then channeled via pipeline to Angola LNG, where it is liquefied and shipped overseas, and supports domestic demand for power as well. A bridge fuel for the energy transition and a major driver for Angola’s economic diversification, over the medium-term natural gas will grow in importance in Azule’s production mix. New Gas Consortium (NGC) A first for Angola. Historically, gas has been captured as a by-product of oil extraction (associated gas). The NGC is different in that it specifically targets to develop and produce non-associated gas located in the offshore gas fields to supply Angola LNG, thereby enhancing the nation’s gas export capability. The NGC will be operated by Azule Energy and is an unincorporated joint venture with Sonangol P&P, Chevron and Total. The non-associated gas of the Phase 1 of the project will come from the Quiluma and Maboqueiro shallow waters field with additional potential related to gas from Blocks 2, 3 and 15/14 areas. The first gas is expected at the start of 2026 and the project is projecting to produce more than 300 mmscfd at plateau. Solar Azule’s first renewable energy business project is Caraculo’s photovoltaic plant, being developed by Solenova, a 50-50% joint venture between Azule Energy and Sonangol created specifically for the promotion of renewable energy projects in Angola. Located in the province of Namibe, the project consists of the phased installation of a 50 Megawatt (MW) photovoltaic plant; the first 25 MW phase became operational in May 2023. Caraculo’s photovoltaic plant will contribute to the reduction of diesel consumption for the generation of electricity and will support the diversification of the energy matrix in Angola, particularly by feeding electricity to the southern territory’s grid. The project also falls within the national government’s “Angola Energy 2025” long-term plan to provide access to basic energy services to the population. Click here and access the Solenova website. Angola LNG The ALNG project was built to create value from offshore associated gas resources and is one of the largest ever single investments in the Angolan oil and gas industry. With a 27.2% share, Azule Energy is one of the four shareholders in this incorporated joint venture, alongside Sonagas, Total and Chevron, the operator. The onshore gas liquefaction plant for the treatment and marketing of gas associated with the production of crude oil is located near Soyo in the Zaire province in north Angola. The installed plant capacity is 5.2 MTPA (million tonnes per annum). Namibia Azule Energy is proud to be part of Namibia’s growing energy story through our participation in PEL85, Block 2914A, located in the Orange Basin, offshore Namibia. We hold a 42.5% interest in the block, alongside our partners Rhino Resources (Operator, 42.5%), NAMCOR (10%), and Korres Investments (5%). In 2025, the Capricornus 1-X exploration well was successfully drilled and tested using the Noble Venturer drillship. The well reached total depth in April and encountered 38 metres of net pay within the Lower Cretaceous target, with strong reservoir quality and no observed water contact. A production test confirmed the presence of high-quality hydrocarbons, with the well flowing at rates of more than 11,000 stb/d of light oil (approximately 37° API), containing less than 2% CO₂ and no hydrogen sulphide. Hydrocarbon samples and cores were collected for further laboratory analysis. This discovery represents an important step toward realising the hydrocarbon potential of the Orange Basin and underscores Azule Energy’s commitment to advancing exploration opportunities in Namibia alongside our partners and stakeholders.
