Oil and Gas: our Exploration and Production operations Oil and Gas: our Exploration and Production operations According to the Net Zero scenario put forward by the International Energy Agency (IEA), hydrocarbons are set to account for half of the world's energy needs in 2030, and will decrease below 20% in 2050. Natural gas is genuinely a transition energy that allows for the ramp up of renewables and provides sustainable fuels in the mobility sector (natural gas for vehicles, marine LNG, etc.). Hence, it plays its full role in our strategy to meet global energy needs. As a multi-energy company present across the entire oil and gas value chain, we aim to provide hydrocarbons that are more affordable, more reliable, cleaner and accessible to as many people as possible. In an industry with an ever-growing number of constraints, we are harnessing our expertise and innovation capabilities to prepare the future of energy for our planet. Our ambition for oil and gas To meet the key challenges in the oil and gas industry, as well as the needs of our partners and stakeholders, we are consolidating our competitive advantage and continuing to increase production with an unwavering commitment to the safety of people and equipment.
